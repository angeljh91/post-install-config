In this example I demonstrate me configuring System Administrator Departments in osTicket. This involves setting up organizational units within the ticketing system. By doing this it establishes clear organizational hierarchy within the help desk, which ensures that tickets are routed to the appropriate teams based on their expertise and responsibilities.
